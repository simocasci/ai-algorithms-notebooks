**Disclaimer**: the notebooks in this repo weren't meant to contain extensible or clean code; they  are a fast way of testing random algorithms I've read about in some papers (or similar).

Here's a list of implemented algorithms:

- **Monte Carlo Control for the game Easy21**: [link](https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Easy21-Johannes.pdf), assignment from the [Reinforcement Learning course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ) by David Silver
